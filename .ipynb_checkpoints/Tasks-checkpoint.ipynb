    "## Task 1: Calculate the square root of 2.\n",
    "The first task is to create a python function called **sqrt2** that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. I will achieve this by using a well known and popular root-finding algorithm known as Newton's method (also known as Newton-Raphson method) [1].\n",

    "### Understanding Newton's Method\n",
    "Newton's method \"produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function\". This means that with ever iteratation we get closer to the \"real-answer\" of what the root of a given number is. Starting with the function $f$ defined for $x$ we can get the derivative [3] $f'$ and with an initial guess of $x_{0}$ for the root of $f$. Then we can use the algorithm above to solve for an answer $x_{1}$ and repeat the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Lets find the square root of a number $a$, that is to say the positive number $x$ such that $x^2=a$. By finding the zero of the function $f(x)=x^2-a$ we can find the derivative $f'(x)=2x$.\n",
    "For example, if we try to find the sqaure root of $a=2$, with an initial guess $x_{0}=1.4$ (initial estimation comes from the graph below) the sequence given by Newton's method is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{1} = x_{0}-\\frac{f(x_{0})}{f'(x_{0})} = 1.4-\\frac{1.4^2-2}{2*1.4} = 1.4142$$\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "When calculating the standard deviation (SD) of any given data set we must determine wether the data set represents _all_ or _part_ of the category of data. Based on this decision we will use either the _Poulation_ SD or the _Sample_ SD. As we have seen above with examples the _Population_ SD answer was **2.53** while the _Sample_ SD answer was **2.5** leaving only **0.03** in the difference $(2.53 - 2.5 = 0.03)$. It proves using the _Sample_ SD formula helps compenstate for the missing data and still gives us an accurate result with a marginal difference. As we have seen using the wrong type of formula will result in **2.64** giving us a difference of **0.14** $(2.64 - 2.5 = 0.14)$ almost five times the differences when used incorrectly.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In conclusion the _Sample_ SD formula is a better estimate for the SD of a data set when performed on a sample."
