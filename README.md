## Setup and Requirements

In order to use this git-repo you will need to have installed on your computer [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install). You can follow the links to download and install them separately, or you can download both in one step by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

Anaconda will be a large download of approx. 450Mbs in size and will contain both Python 3 and Jupyter in its installation. Once downloaded run the install wizard and upon finishing you will be able to run the program found in this git-repo.
