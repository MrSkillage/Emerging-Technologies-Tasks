# Emerging-Technologies-Tasks

**Version 1.0.0**

A README for a 4th Year assignment in the module Emerging Technologies. This assignment consists of 4 tasks to be researched, summarized, and coded in python using Jupyter Notebook.

## Setup and Requirements

In order to use this git-repo you will need to have installed on your computer [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install). You can follow the links to download and install them separately, or you can download both in one step by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

Anaconda will be a large download of approx. 450Mbs in size and will contain both Python 3 and Jupyter in its installation. Once downloaded run the install wizard and upon finishing you will be able to run the program found in this git-repo.

## Running the Program

Clone the git-repo to your computer and you should have the following folder structure.
