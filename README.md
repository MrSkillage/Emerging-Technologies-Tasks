# Emerging-Technologies-Tasks

**Version 1.0.0**

A README for a 4th Year assignment in the module Emerging Technologies. This assignment consists of 4 tasks to be researched, summarized, and coded in python using Jupyter Notebook.

## Setup and Requirements

In order to use this git-repo you will need to have installed on your computer [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install). You can follow the links to download and install them separately, or you can download both in one step by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

Anaconda will be a large download of approx. 450Mbs in size and will contain both Python 3 and Jupyter in its installation. Once downloaded run the install wizard and upon finishing you will be able to run the program found in this git-repo.

## Running the Program

Clone the git-repo to your computer and you should have the following folder structure.

This will open up the Jupyter Notebook program in your default browser. Click on the item 'Tasks.ipynb' as seen below.

![Jupyter_Notebook](img/Jupyter_Notebook.png)

This will open a new tab in your browser with the Tasks assignment running in Jupyter Notebook.

Now click on the tab 'Kernel' and in the dropdown menu select the 'Restart & Run All' option. This will restart the program and run each line sequentially.

You are now ready to use the Tasks program. You can read through and even edit, if you wish, the Markdown and/or Python cells.
